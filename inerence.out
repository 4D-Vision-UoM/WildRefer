/home/avishka/anaconda3/envs/wildrefer_env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/huggingface_hub/file_download.py:945: FutureWarning: `resume_download` is deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0.0. Downloads always resume when possible. If you want to force a new download, use `force_download=True`.
  warnings.warn(
Some weights of the model checkpoint at roberta-base were not used when initializing RobertaModel: ['lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.decoder.weight', 'lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

/home/avishka/sasika/WildRefer/models/position_encoding.py:37: UserWarning: __floordiv__ is deprecated, and its behavior will change in a future version of pytorch. It currently rounds toward 0 (like the 'trunc' function NOT 'floor'). This results in incorrect rounding for negative values. To keep the current behavior, use torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='trunc'), or for actual floor division, use torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='floor').
